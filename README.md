### What I've Learned, Continued development & Useful resources

Thanks Jessica (Coder Coder)! 

- [Building an accordion with HTML, CSS & JS (Part 1)](https://youtu.be/FboXxLxg8eo) 
- [How to build an accordion with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Part 2)](https://youtu.be/sr94O6Y5NEA) 

These videos were amazing. Not only I learned some CSS properties and JavaScript syntax, but also the thought process behind building a project through reverse engineering by a professional web developer. Next time, I'm hoping to use some of techniques in building another Frondend Mentor challenge or a project of my own.
